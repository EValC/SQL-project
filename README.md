# SQL-project
sql queries along with their data
This Product mostly similar to a Commercial Super Markets system of managing their billing, marketing, inventories and creating invoices. 
All the transactions that are made are stored in RDBMS database to which we develop connections to retrieve them and to process. 
We were asked to design and implement some queries as stored procedures
which can be run on specific time slots and those results are needed to be displayed on the C#.Net web forms. 
Even sometimes we need to store data using the forms then we need to implement post operation which stores data into the database.
